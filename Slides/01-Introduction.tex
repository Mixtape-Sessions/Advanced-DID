\begin{frame}{Who Am I?}
  \begin{wideitemize}

    \item
    Assistant Professor of Economics at Brown University.

    \item
    I consider myself an \textit{applied econometrician}.

    \item
    The main goal of my research is to develop \textit{usable} tools that improve the quality of empirical work.

  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{My DiD Journey}

  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item
    Early-on in graduate school, I was an aspiring labor economist running a lot of DiDs...

\begin{frame}{My DiD Journey}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item
    I realized I had a lot of questions about the methodology of what I was doing.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
            Should I believe parallel trends holds in this context?

      \item
            Why do I have pre-trends in some of my specifications but not others?

      \item
            Is it okay if I focus only on the specifications without pre-trends...?
    \end{itemize}

    \pause
    \item Pretty quickly I started writing methodological papers about these topics
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
            I never published the Act 10 paper -- oops!
    \end{itemize}

    \item But the goal of my research has always been to try to inform real-world analyses of economic topics

    \pause
    \item Today I hope to share with you some of the insights that I and others have learned over the last few years, with the \textbf{goal of helping you improve your research.}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
            Focus on both theory and applying it in practice!
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item
    \textbf{Difference-in-differences} (DiD) is one of the most popular strategies for estimating causal effects in non-experimental contexts.
    \medskip
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
            Used in over 20\% of NBER WPs \citep{currie_technology_2020}
    \end{itemize}

    \item
    The last few years have seen an explosion of econometrics on DiD, making it hard to keep up (sorry!)

    \item
    In Roth, Sant'Anna, Bilinski, and Poe (Forthcoming JOE), we attempted to synthesize the recent literature and provide concrete recommendations for practitioners


    \item
    This course is loosely based on the structure in that paper, focusing on staggered timing (Section 3) and violations of parallel trends (Section 4)
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{The simplest case}
  \begin{wideitemize}

    \item
    We will start a description of DiD in the simplest ``canonical'' case

    \item
    Why? Because recent DiD lit can be viewed as relaxing various components of the canonical model while preserving others
  \end{wideitemize}


  \pause
  In the canonical DiD model, we have:

  \medskip


  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item
    2 periods: treatment occurs (for some units) in period 2

    \item
    Identification of the ATT from parallel trends and no anticipation

    \item
    Estimation using sample analogs, equivalent to OLS with TWFE

    \item
    A large number of independent observations (or clusters)
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Canonical DiD -- with math}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item
    Panel data on $Y_{it}$ for $t=1,2$ and $i = 1,...,N$

    \item
    \textbf{Treatment timing:} Some units ($D_i=1$) are treated in period $2$; everyone else is untreated $(D_i=0)$

    \pause
    \item
    \textbf{Potential outcomes:} Observe $Y_{it}(1) \equiv Y_{it}(0,1)$ for treated units; and $Y_{it}(0) \equiv Y_{it}(0,0)$ for comparison
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Key identifying assumptions}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item
    \textbf{Parallel trends:}
    \begin{equation}
      \expe{ Y_{i2}(0) - Y_{i1}(0) \,|\, D_i = 1 } = \expe{ Y_{i2}(0) - Y_{i1}(0) \,|\, D_i = 0 } . \label{eqn: pt - 2 periods}
    \end{equation}


    \pause
    \item
    \textbf{No anticipation:} $Y_{i1}(1) = Y_{i1}(0)$
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
            Intuitively, outcome in period 1 isn't affected by treatment status in period 2

      \item
            Often left implicit in notation, but important for interpreting DiD estimand as a causal effect in period 2
    \end{itemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Identification}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item
    \textbf{Target parameter:} Average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) in period 2

    $$\tau_{ATT} = E[Y_{i2}(1) - Y_{i2}(0) | D_i=1] $$

    \pause
    \item
    Under parallel trends and no anticipation, can show that

    $$\tau_{ATT} = \underbrace{(E[Y_{i2} | D_i = 1] - E[Y_{i1}| D_i =1])}_{\text{Change for treated}} - \underbrace{(E[Y_{i2} | D_i = 0] - E[Y_{i1}| D_i =0]) }_{\text{Change for control}},$$

    \noindent a ``difference-in-differences'' of population means
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Proof of Identification Argument}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
          Start with
          \vspace{-3mm}
          $$E[Y_{i2}- Y_{i1}| D_i =1] - E[Y_{i2} - Y_{i1}| D_i =0]$$
          
          \pause
    \vspace{-3mm}
    \item
          Apply definition of POs to obtain:
          \vspace{-3mm}
          $$E[Y_{i2}(1) - Y_{i1}(1)| D_i =1] - E[Y_{i2}(0) - Y_{i1}(0)| D_i =0]$$
          
          \pause
    \vspace{-3mm}
    \item
          Use No Anticipation to substitute $Y_{i1}(0)$ for $Y_{i1}(1)$:
          \vspace{-3mm}
          $$E[Y_{i2}(1) - Y_{i1}(0)| D_i =1] - E[Y_{i2}(0) - Y_{i1}(0)| D_i =0]$$
          
          \pause
    \vspace{-3mm}
    \item
          Add and subtract $E[ Y_{i2}(0) | D_i =1] $ to obtain:
          \vspace{-3mm}
          \begin{align*}
              & \electricViolet{E[ Y_{i2}(1) - Y_{i2}(0) | D_i =1]} + \\
              & \hspace{1cm} \sun{\left[ (E[Y_{i2}(0) | D_i = 1] - E[Y_{i1}(0)| D_i =1]) - (E[Y_{i2}(0) | D_i = 0] - E[Y_{i1}(0)| D_i =0]) \right]}
          \end{align*}
          
          \pause
    \vspace{-3mm}
    \item
      Cancel the \sun{last terms} using PT to get $\electricViolet{E[Y_{i2}(1) - Y_{i2}(0) | D_i = 1] = \tau_{ATT}}$
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Estimation and Inference}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item
    The most conceptually simple estimator replaces population means with sample analogs:
    $$\hat{\tau}_{DiD} = (\bar{Y}_{12} - \bar{Y}_{11}) - (\bar{Y}_{02} - \bar{Y}_{01}) $$
    \noindent where $\bar{Y}_{dt}$ is sample mean for group $d$ in period $t$

    \pause
    \item
    Conveniently, $\hat\tau_{DID}$ is algebraically equal to OLS coefficient $\hat\beta$ from
    \begin{equation}
      Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \phi_t + D_{it} \beta  + \epsilon_{it}, \label{eqn: TWFE-2-periods}
    \end{equation}
    \noindent where $D_{it} = D_i * 1[t=2]$. Also equivalent to $\beta$ from $\Delta Y_{i} = \alpha +  \Delta D_i \beta + u_{it}$.
    \pause
    \item
    \textbf{Inference:} And clustered standard errors are valid as number of clusters grows large
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Characterizing the recent literature}
  We can group the recent innovations in DiD lit by which elements of the canonical model they relax:
  \medskip

  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item
    \textbf{Multiple periods and staggered treatment timing}

    \item
    \textbf{Relaxing or allowing PT to be violated}

    \item
    \textbf{Inference with a small number of clusters}

  \end{wideitemize}
  \medskip
  Will focus today on the first two
