	abstract = {This paper proposes tools for robust inference in difference-in-differences and event-study designs where the parallel trends assumption may be violated. Instead of requiring that parallel trends holds exactly, we impose restrictions on how different the post-treatment violations of parallel trends can be from the pre-treatment differences in trends (“pre-trends”). The causal parameter of interest is partially identified under these restrictions. We introduce two approaches that guarantee uniformly valid inference under the imposed restrictions, and we derive novel results showing that they have desirable power properties in our context. We illustrate how economic knowledge can inform the restrictions on the possible violations of parallel trends in two economic applications. We also highlight how our approach can be used to conduct sensitivity analyses showing what causal conclusions can be drawn under various restrictions on the possible violations of the parallel trends assumption.},

We begin by articulating a simple set of “canonical” assumptions under which the econometrics of DiD are well-understood. We then argue that recent advances in DiD methods can be broadly classified as relaxing some components of the canonical DiD setup, with a focus on (i) multiple periods and variation in treatment timing, (ii) potential violations of parallel trends, or (iii) alternative frameworks for inference. Our discussion highlights the different ways that the DiD literature has advanced beyond the canonical model, and helps to clarify when each of the papers will be relevant for empirical work. We conclude by discussing some promising areas for future research.},

In the case of pure treatment models, where all observations within clusters are either treated or not, the latter procedure can work remarkably well. The key requirement is that all cluster sizes, regardless of treatment, should be similar. Unfortunately, the analogue of this requirement is not likely to hold for difference-in-differences regressions.

Our methods work in conjunction with many different approaches for predicting counterfactual mean outcomes in the absence of the policy intervention.

We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference.

We survey the nascent literature and document how and when such bias arises from treatment eﬀect heterogeneity. We apply recently proposed methods to a set of prior published results, and ﬁnd that correcting for the bias induced by the staggered nature of policy adoption frequently impacts the estimated eﬀect from standard diﬀerence-indiﬀerence studies.

	title = {When {Should} {You} {Adjust} {Standard} {Errors} for {Clustering}?},
	url = {https://www.nber.org/papers/w24003},
	abstract = {In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that account for clustering of units. Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. This motivation also makes it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, and in the second stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters. We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter.},

	abstract = {Social scientists are often interested in estimating causal effects in settings where all units in the population are observed (e.g. all 50 US states). Design-based approaches, which view the treatment as the random object of interest, may be more appealing than standard sampling-based approaches in such contexts. This paper develops a design-based theory of uncertainty suitable for quasi-experimental settings, in which the researcher estimates the treatment effect as if treatment was randomly assigned, but in reality treatment probabilities may depend in unknown ways on the potential outcomes. We first study the properties of the simple difference-in-means (SDIM) estimator. The SDIM is unbiased for a finite-population design-based analog to the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) if treatment probabilities are uncorrelated with the potential outcomes in a finite population sense. We further derive expressions for the variance of the SDIM estimator and a central limit theorem under sequences of finite populations with growing sample size. We then show how our results can be applied to analyze the distribution and estimand of difference-in-differences (DiD) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) from a design-based perspective when treatment is not completely randomly assigned.},

I propose estimation strategies that can remove both sources of bias and semi-parametrically estimate the spillover effects themselves including in settings with staggered treatment timing.

abstract = {We propose strategies to estimate and make inference on key features of heterogeneous effects in randomized experiments. These key features include best linear predictors of the effects on machine learning proxies, average effects sorted by impact groups, and average characteristics of most and least impacted units. The approach is valid in high dimensional settings, where the effects are proxied by machine learning methods. We post-process these proxies into the estimates of the key features. Our approach is generic, it can be used in conjunction with penalized methods, deep and shallow neural networks, canonical and new random forests, boosted trees, and ensemble methods. Estimation and inference are based on repeated data splitting to avoid overfitting and achieve validity. For inference, we take medians of p-values and medians of confidence intervals, resulting from many different data splits, and then adjust their nominal level to guarantee uniform validity. This variational inference method, which quantifies the uncertainty coming from both parameter estimation and data splitting, is shown to be uniformly valid for a large class of data generating processes. We illustrate the use of the approach with a randomized field experiment that evaluated a combination of nudges to stimulate demand for immunization in India.},

In this article, we develop a nonparametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman's widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference.

The yield corresponding to only one variety will be observed on any given plot, but through an urn model embodying sampling without replacement from this doubly indexed array, Neyman obtains a formula for the variance of the difference between the averages of the observed yields of two varieties. This variance involves the variance over all plots of the potential yields and the correlation coefficient r between the potential yields of the two varieties on the same plot. Since it is impossible to estimate r directly, Neyman advises taking r = 1, observing that in practice this may lead to using too large an estimated standard deviation, when comparing two variety means.},

	abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave employment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data file. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated. We reanalyze the mortality experience of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers with our method and compare our results with those obtained using standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on all-cause and lung cancer mortality which standard methods fail to detect.},

Contrary to conventional wisdom, he argued that adjustment can lead to worsened asymptotic precision, invalid measures of precision, and small-sample bias. This paper shows that in sufficiently large samples, those problems are either minor or easily fixed. OLS adjustment cannot hurt asymptotic precision when a full set of treatment–covariate interactions is included. Asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be constructed with the Huber–White sandwich standard error estimator. Checks on the asymptotic approximations are illustrated with data from Angrist, Lang, and Oreopoulos’s [Am. Econ. J.: Appl. Econ. 1:1 (2009) 136–163] evaluation of strategies to improve college students’ achievement. The strongest reasons to support Freedman’s preference for unadjusted estimates are transparency and the dangers of specification search.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of inference in observational studies with time-varying adoption of treatment. In addition to an unconfoundedness assumption that the potential outcomes are independent of the times at which units adopt treatment conditional on the units' observed characteristics, our analysis assumes that the time at which each unit adopts treatment follows a Cox proportional hazards model. This assumption permits the time at which each unit adopts treatment to depend on the observed characteristics of the unit, but imposes the restriction that the probability of multiple units adopting treatment at the same time is zero. In this context, we study Fisher-style randomization tests of a null hypothesis that specifies that there is no treatment effect for all units and all time periods in a distributional sense. We first show that an infeasible test that treats the parameters of the Cox model as known has rejection probability no greater than the nominal level in finite samples. We then establish that the feasible test that replaces these parameters with consistent estimators has limiting rejection probability no greater than the nominal level. In a simulation study, we examine the practical relevance of our theoretical results, including robustness to misspecification of the model for the time at which each unit adopts treatment. Finally, we provide an empirical application of our methodology using the synthetic control-based test statistic and tobacco legislation data found in Abadie et. al. (2010).},

While such a design is suitable for study of highly autocorrelated and relatively precisely measured outcomes in the health and education domains, it is unlikely to be optimal for measuring noisy and relatively less autocorrelated outcomes such as business profits, and household incomes and expenditures. Taking multiple measurements of such outcomes at relatively short intervals allows one to average out noise, increasing power. When the outcomes have low autocorrelation and budget is limited, it can make sense to do no baseline at all. Moreover, I show how for such outcomes, more power can be achieved with multiple follow-ups than allocating the same total sample size over a single follow-up and baseline. I also highlight the large gains in power from ANCOVA analysis rather than difference-in-differences analysis when autocorrelations are low.},

Randomization tests provide a general means of constructing tests that control size in finite samples whenever the distribution of the observed data exhibits symmetry under the null hypothesis. Here, by exhibits symmetry we mean that the distribution remains invariant under a group of transformations. In this paper, we provide conditions under which the same construction can be used to construct tests that asymptotically control the probability of a false rejection whenever the distribution of the observed data exhibits approximate symmetry in the sense that the limiting distribution of a function of the data exhibits symmetry under the null hypothesis. An important application of this idea is in settings where the data may be grouped into a fixed number of "clusters" with a large number of observations within each cluster. In such settings, we show that the distribution of the observed data satisfies our approximate symmetry requirement under weak assumptions. In particular, our results allow for the clusters to be heterogeneous and also have dependence not only within each cluster, but also across clusters. This approach enjoys several advantages over other approaches in these settings.},

The usual solution is to calculate cluster-robust standard errors that permit heteroskedasticity and within-cluster error correlation, but presume that the number of clusters is large. Standard asymptotic tests can over-reject, however, with few (five to thirty) clusters. We investigate inference using cluster bootstrap-t procedures that provide asymptotic refinement. These procedures are evaluated using Monte Carlos, including the example of Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullain-athan (2004). Rejection rates of 10{\%} using standard methods can be reduced to the nominal size of 5{\%} using our methods.},

Our discussion highlights the different ways that the DiD literature has advanced beyond the canonical model, and helps to clarify when each of the papers will be relevant for empirical work.

We provide a novel characterization: the parallel trends assumption holds under all strictly monotonic transformations of the outcome if and only if a stronger "parallel trends"-type condition holds for the cumulative distribution function of untreated potential outcomes. This condition is satisfied if and essentially only if the population can be partitioned into a subgroup for which treatment is effectively randomly assigned and a remaining subgroup for which the distribution of untreated potential outcomes is stable over time. We show further that it is impossible to construct any estimator that is consistent (or unbiased) for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) without either imposing functional form restrictions or imposing assumptions that identify the full distribution of untreated potential outcomes. Our results suggest that researchers who wish to point-identify the ATT should justify one of the following: (i) why treatment is as-if randomly assigned, (ii) why the chosen functional form is correct at the exclusion of others, or (iii) a method for inferring the entire counterfactual distribution of untreated potential outcomes.},

I analyze the properties of the traditional DiD estimator conditional on having passed (i.e. not rejected) the test for parallel pre-trends. When the DiD design is valid and the test for pre-trends confirms it, the typical DiD estimator is unbiased, but traditional standard errors are overly conservative. Additionally, there exists an alternative unbiased estimator that is more efficient than the traditional DiD estimator under parallel trends. However, when in population there is a non-zero pre-trend but we fail to reject the hypothesis of parallel pre-trends, the DiD estimator is generally biased relative to the population DiD coefficient. Moreover, if the trend is monotone, then under reasonable assumptions the bias from conditioning exacerbates the bias relative to the true treatment effect. I propose new estimation and inference procedures that account for the test for parallel trends, and compare their performance to that of the traditional estimator in a Monte Carlo simulation.},

We discuss alternative, typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular two-way fixed-effect specifications can be hard to interpret, even when there are only two time periods.

Those parameters generalize the average effect of having started receiving the treatment \${\textbackslash}ell\$ periods ago that has often been estimated in applications with a binary treatment and staggered adoption. We also consider cost-benefit ratios a planner may use to compare the treatments actually assigned to a counterfactual status quo scenario where groups receive their period-one treatment throughout the panel. We show that under common trends conditions, all these parameters are unbiasedly estimated by weighted sums of differences-in-differences. Our estimators are valid if the treatment effect is heterogeneous, contrary to the commonly-used dynamic two-way fixed effects regressions. We also propose estimators of a dynamic linear model, with group-specific but time-invariant effects of the current and lagged treatments, which may be used to evaluate ex-ante the effect of future policies.

In this paper, I extend this literature in two ways. First, I provide some simple underlying intuition for why diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences regression does not identify a group×period average treatment eﬀect. Second, I propose an alternative twostage estimation framework, motivated by this intuition. In this framework, group and period eﬀects are identiﬁed in a ﬁrst stage from the sample of untreated observations, and average treatment eﬀects are identiﬁed in a second stage by comparing treated and untreated outcomes, after removing these group and period eﬀects. The two-stage approach is robust to treatment-eﬀect heterogeneity under staggered adoption, and can be used to identify a host of diﬀerent average treatment eﬀect measures. It is also simple, intuitive, and easy to implement. I establish the theoretical properties of the two-stage approach and demonstrate its eﬀectiveness and applicability using Monte-Carlo evidence and an example from the literature.},

These problems arise when researchers conflate the identifying assumptions of parallel trends and no anticipatory effects, implicit assumptions that restrict treatment effect heterogeneity, and the specification of the estimand as a weighted average of treatment effects. We then derive the efficient estimator robust to treatment effect heterogeneity for this setting, show that it has a particularly intuitive "imputation" form when treatment-effect heterogeneity is unrestricted, characterize its asymptotic behavior, provide tools for inference, and illustrate its attractive properties in simulations.

To date, there has been no formal inference theory for synthetic control ATE estimator with long panels under general conditions. Existing work mostly use placebo tests for inference or by some permutation methods when the post-treatment period is small.

	abstract = {This paper studies inference on treatment effects in aggregate panel data settings with a single treated unit and many control units. We propose new methods for making inference on average treatment effects in settings where both the number of pre-treatment and the number of post-treatment periods are large. We use linear models to approximate the counterfactual mean outcomes in the absence of the treatment. The counterfactuals are estimated using constrained Lasso, an essentially tuning free regression approach that nests difference-in-differences and synthetic control as special cases. We propose a K-fold cross-fitting procedure to remove the bias induced by regularization. To avoid the estimation of the long run variance, we construct a self-normalized t-statistic. The test statistic has an asymptotically pivotal distribution (a student t-distribution with K - 1 degrees of freedom), which makes our procedure very easy to implement. Our approach has several theoretical advantages. First, it does not rely on any sparsity assumptions. Second, it is fully robust against misspecification of the linear model. Third, it is more efficient than difference-in-means and difference-in-differences estimators. The proposed method demonstrates an excellent performance in simulation experiments, and is taken to a data application, where we re-evaluate the economic consequences of terrorism.},

	abstract = {The synthetic control (SC) method has been recently proposed as an alternative to estimate treatment effects in comparative case studies. In this paper, we revisit the SC method in a linear factor model setting and consider the asymptotic properties of the SC estimator when the number of pre-treatment periods (T\_0) goes to infinity. Differently from  Abadie et al. (2010), we do not condition the analysis on a close-to-perfect pre-treatment fit, as the probability that this happens goes to zero when T\_0 is large. We show that, even when a close-to-perfect fit is not achieved, the SC method can substantially improve relative to the difference-in-differences (DID) estimator, both in terms of bias and variance. However, we show that, in our setting, the SC estimator is asymptotically biased if treatment assignment is correlated with the unobserved heterogeneity. If common factors are stationary, then the asymptotic bias of the SC estimator  goes to zero when the variance of the transitory shocks is small, which is also the case in which it is more likely that the pre-treatment fit will be good. If a subset of the common factors is non-stationary, then the SC estimator can be asymptotically biased even conditional on a close-to-perfect  fit. In this case, the identification assumption relies on orthogonality between treatment assignment and the stationary common factors. Finally, we also consider the statistical properties of the permutation tests suggested in Abadie et al. (2010).},

The method constructs a set of weights such that selected covariates and pre-treatment outcomes of the treated unit are approximately matched by a weighted average of control units (the synthetic control). The weights are restricted to be nonnegative and sum to one, which is important because it allows the procedure to obtain unique weights even when the number of lagged outcomes is modest relative to the number of control units, a common setting in applications. In the current paper we propose a generalization that allows the weights to be negative, and their sum to diﬀer from one, and that allows for a permanent additive diﬀerence between the treated unit and the controls, similar to diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence procedures. The weights directly minimize the distance between the lagged outcomes for the treated and the control units, using regularization methods to deal with a potentially large number of possible control units.},

I provide a general framework for this setting, tailored to predict the counterfactual by minimizing a tradeoff between underfitting (bias) and overfitting (variance). The framework nests recently proposed structural and reduced form machine learning approaches as special cases. Furthermore, difference-in-differences with matching and the original synthetic control are restrictive cases of the framework, in general not minimizing the bias-variance objective. Using simulation studies I find that machine learning methods outperform traditional methods when the number of potential controls is large or the treated unit is substantially different from the controls. Equipped with a toolbox of approaches, I revisit a study on the effect of economic liberalisation on economic growth. I find effects for several countries where no effect was found in the original study. Furthermore, I inspect how a systematically important bank respond to increasing capital requirements by using a large pool of banks to estimate the counterfactual.

@article{Ben-Michael2021,
abstract = {Staggered adoption of policies by different units at different times creates promising opportunities for observational causal inference. Estimation remains challenging, however, and common regression methods can give misleading results. A promising alternative is the synthetic control method (SCM), which finds a weighted average of control units that closely balances the treated unit's pre-treatment outcomes. In this paper, we generalize SCM, originally designed to study a single treated unit, to the staggered adoption setting. We first bound the error for the average effect and show that it depends on both the imbalance for each treated unit separately and the imbalance for the average of the treated units. We then propose "partially pooled" SCM weights to minimize a weighted combination of these measures; approaches that focus only on balancing one of the two components can lead to bias. We extend this approach to incorporate unit-level intercept shifts and auxiliary covariates. We assess the performance of the proposed method via extensive simulations and apply our results to the question of whether teacher collective bargaining leads to higher school spending, finding minimal impacts. We implement the proposed method in the augsynth R package.},

	abstract = {Synthetic control methods are commonly applied in empirical research to estimate the eﬀects of treatments or interventions of interest on aggregate outcomes. A synthetic control estimator compares the outcome of a treated unit – that is, a unit exposed to the intervention of interest – to the outcome of a weighted average of untreated units that best resembles the characteristics of the treated unit before the intervention. When disaggregated data are available, constructing separate synthetic controls for each treated unit may help avoid interpolation biases. However, the problem of ﬁnding a synthetic control that best reproduces the characteristics of a treated unit may not have a unique solution. Multiplicity of solutions is a particularly daunting challenge in settings with disaggregated data, that is, when the sample includes many treated and untreated units. To address this challenge, we propose a synthetic control estimator that penalizes the pairwise discrepancies between the characteristics of the treated units and the characteristics of the units that contribute to their synthetic controls. The penalization parameter trades oﬀ pairwise matching discrepancies with respect to the characteristics of each unit in the synthetic control against matching discrepancies with respect to the characteristics of the synthetic control unit as a whole. We study the properties of this estimator and propose data driven choices of the penalization parameter.},

It imputes counterfactuals for each treated unit using control group information based on a linear interactive fixed effects model that incorporates unit-specific intercepts interacted with time-varying coefficients. This method has several advantages. First, it allows the treatment to be correlated with unobserved unit and time heterogeneities under reasonable modeling assumptions. Second, it generalizes the synthetic control method to the case of multiple treated units and variable treatment periods, and improves efficiency and interpretability. Third, with a built-in cross-validation procedure, it avoids specification searches and thus is easy to implement.

When selection bias is symmetric around the treatment date, DID is consistent when implemented symmetrically—i.e. comparing outcomes observed the same number of periods before and after the treatment date. When selection bias is not symmetric, Monte Carlo simulations show that Symmetric DID still performs better than Matching, especially in the middle of the life-cycle. These results are consistent with estimates of the bias of Matching and DID from randomly assigned JTPs.

Sniff tests offer a new window into publication bias since authors prefer them to be insignificant, the reverse of standard statistical tests. Collecting a sample of nearly 30,000 sniff tests across 60 economics journals, we provide the first estimate of their aggregate probability-value (p-value) distribution. For the subsample of balance tests in randomized controlled trials (for which the distribution of p-values is known to be uniform absent publication bias, allowing reduced-form methods to be employed) estimates suggest that 45\% of failed tests remain in the "file drawer" rather than being published. For the remaining sample with an unknown distribution of p-values, structural estimates suggest an even larger file-drawer problem, as high as 91\%. Fewer significant sniff tests show up in top-tier journals, smaller tables, and more recent articles. We find no evidence of author manipulation other than a tendency to overly attribute significant sniff tests to bad luck.},

	abstract = {Many questions in econometrics can be cast as inference on a parameter selected through optimization. For example, researchers may be interested in the effectiveness of the best policy found in a randomized trial, or the best-performing investment strategy based on historical data. Such settings give rise to a winner's curse, where conventional estimates are biased and conventional confi dence intervals are unreliable. This paper develops optimal con fidence sets and median-unbiased estimators that are valid conditional on the parameter selected and so overcome this winner's curse. If one requires validity only on average over target parameters that might have been selected, we develop hybrid procedures that combine conditional and projection con fidence sets and offer further performance gains that are attractive relative to existing alternatives.},

Not surprisingly, we find that decriminalization increased the size of the indoor market. However, we also find that decriminalization caused both forcible rape offenses and gonorrhea incidence to decline for the overall population. Our synthetic control model finds 824 fewer reported rape offenses (31 percent decrease) and 1,035 fewer cases of female gonorrhea (39 percent decrease) from 2004 to 2009.},

We propose a model that allows the control and treatment groups to have different average benefits from the treatment. The assumptions of the proposed model are invariant to the scaling of the outcome. We provide conditions under which the model is nonparametrically identified and propose an estimator that can be applied using either repeated cross section or panel data. Our approach provides an estimate of the entire counterfactual distribution of outcomes that would have been experienced by the treatment group in the absence of the treatment and likewise for the untreated group in the presence of the treatment. Thus, it enables the evaluation of policy interventions according to criteria such as a mean-variance trade-off. We also propose methods for inference, showing that our estimator for the average treatment effect is root-N consistent and asymptotically normal. We consider extensions to allow for covariates, discrete dependent variables, and multiple groups and time periods.},

	abstract = {[The difference-in-differences (DID) estimator is one of the most popular tools for applied research in economics to evaluate the effects of public interventions and other treatments of interest on some relevant outcome variables. However, it is well known that the DID estimator is based on strong identifying assumptions. In particular, the conventional DID estimator requires that, in the absence of the treatment, the average outcomes for the treated and control groups would have followed parallel paths over time. This assumption may be implausible if pre-treatment characteristics that are thought to be associated with the dynamics of the outcome variable are unbalanced between the treated and the untreated. That would be the case, for example, if selection for treatment is influenced by individual-transitory shocks on past outcomes (Ashenfelter's dip). This article considers the case in which differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between treated and controls. It is shown that, in such a case, a simple two-step strategy can be used to estimate the average effect of the treatment for the treated. In addition, the estimation framework proposed in this article allows the use of covariates to describe how the average effect of the treatment varies with changes in observed characteristics.]},

To illustrate the severity of this issue, we randomly generate placebo laws in state-level data on female wages from the Current Population Survey. For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its “effect” as well as the standard error of this estimate. These conventional DD standard errors severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators: we find an “effect” significant at the 5 percent level for up to 45 percent of the placebo interventions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well existing methods help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the autocorrelation of the data) works well when the number of states is large enough. Two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the variance-covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of states and one correction that collapses the time series information into a “pre”- and “post”-period and explicitly takes into account the effective sample size works well even for small numbers of states.},

First, we show that in the presence of unit and time fixed effects, it is impossible to identify the linear component of the path of pre-trends and dynamic treatment effects. Second, we propose graphical and statistical tests for pre-trends. Third, we consider commonly-used "static" regressions, with a treatment dummy instead of a full set of leads and lags around the treatment event, and we show that OLS does not recover a weighted average of the treatment effects: long-term effects are weighted negatively, and we introduce a different estimator that is robust to this issue. Fourth, we show that equivalent problems of under-identification and negative weighting arise in difference-in-differences settings when the control group is allowed to be on a different time trend or in the presence of unit-specific time trends. Finally, we show the practical relevance of these issues in a series of examples from the existing literature, with a focus on the estimation of the marginal propensity to consume out of tax rebates.},

	abstract = {Some empirical results are more likely to be published than others. Such selective publication leads to biased estimates and distorted inference. This paper proposes two approaches for identifying the conditional probability of publication as a function of a study’s results, the first based on systematic replication studies and the second based on meta-studies. For known conditional publication probabilities, we propose median-unbiased estimators and associated confidence sets that correct for selective publication. We apply our methods to recent large-scale replication studies in experimental economics and psychology, and to meta-studies of the effects of minimum wages and de-worming programs.},

This places strong limits on estimators, bias correction methods, and inference procedures, and provides motivation for considering other criteria for evaluating estimators and inference procedures, such as local asymptotic minimaxity and one-sided quantile unbiasedness.},

	shorttitle = {Weak {Convergence} and {Empirical} {Processes}},
	abstract = {This book tries to do three things. The first goal is to give an exposition of certain modes of stochastic convergence, in particular convergence in distribution. The classical theory of this subject was developed mostly in the 1950s and is well summarized in Billingsley (1968). During the last 15 years, the need for a more general theory allowing random elements that are not Borel measurable has become well established, particularly in developing the theory of empirical processes. Part 1 of the book, Stochastic Convergence, gives an exposition of such a theory following the ideas of J. Hoffmann-J!1Jrgensen and R. M. Dudley. A second goal is to use the weak convergence theory background devel oped in Part 1 to present an account of major components of the modern theory of empirical processes indexed by classes of sets and functions. The weak convergence theory developed in Part 1 is important for this, simply because the empirical processes studied in Part 2, Empirical Processes, are naturally viewed as taking values in nonseparable Banach spaces, even in the most elementary cases, and are typically not Borel measurable. Much of the theory presented in Part 2 has previously been scattered in the journal literature and has, as a result, been accessible only to a relatively small number of specialists. In view of the importance of this theory for statis tics, we hope that the presentation given here will make this theory more accessible to statisticians as well as to probabilists interested in statistical applications.},

	abstract = {Valid inference after model selection is currently a very active area of research. The polyhedral method, pioneered by Lee et al. (2016), allows for valid inference after model selection if the model selection event can be described by polyhedral constraints. In that reference, the method is exemplified by constructing two valid confidence intervals when the Lasso estimator is used to select a model. We here study the expected length of these intervals. For one of these confidence intervals, that is easier to compute, we find that its expected length is always infinite. For the other of these confidence intervals, whose computation is more demanding, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for its expected length to be infinite. In simulations, we find that this condition is typically satisfied.},

	abstract = {We propose a bootstrap-based calibrated projection procedure to build confidence intervals for single components and for smooth functions of a partially identified parameter vector in moment (in)equality models. The method controls asymptotic coverage uniformly over a large class of data generating processes. The extreme points of the calibrated projection confidence interval are obtained by extremizing the value of the function of interest subject to a proper relaxation of studentized sample analogs of the moment (in)equality conditions. The degree of relaxation, or critical level, is calibrated so that the function of \${\textbackslash}theta \$, not \${\textbackslash}theta \$ itself, is uniformly asymptotically covered with prespecified probability. This calibration is based on repeatedly checking feasibility of linear programming problems, rendering it computationally attractive. Nonetheless, the program defining an extreme point of the confidence interval is generally nonlinear and potentially intricate. We provide an algorithm, based on the response surface method for global optimization, that approximates the solution rapidly and accurately, and we establish its rate of convergence. The algorithm is of independent interest for optimization problems with simple objectives and complicated constraints. An empirical application estimating an entry game illustrates the usefulness of the method. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the accuracy of the solution algorithm, the good statistical as well as computational performance of calibrated projection (including in comparison to other methods), and the algorithm's potential to greatly accelerate computation of other confidence intervals.},

@article{Chabe-Ferret2015,
abstract = {Matching and Difference in Difference (DID) are two widespread methods that use pre-treatment outcomes to correct for selection bias. I detail the sources of bias of both estimators in a model of earnings dynamics and entry into a Job Training Program (JTP) and I assess their performances using Monte Carlo simulations of the model calibrated with realistic parameter values. I find that Matching generally underestimates the average causal effect of the program and gets closer to the true effect when conditioning on an increasing number of pre-treatment outcomes. When selection bias is symmetric around the treatment date, DID is consistent when implemented symmetrically - i.e. comparing outcomes observed the same number of periods before and after the treatment date. When selection bias is not symmetric, Monte Carlo simulations show that Symmetric DID still performs better than Matching, especially in the middle of the life-cycle. These results are consistent with estimates of the bias of Matching and DID from randomly assigned JTPs. Some of the virtues of Symmetric DID extend to programs other than JTPs allocated according to a cutoff eligibility rule.},

A key issue in the economics of science is finding effective mechanisms for innovation. A concern about research grants and other research and development subsidies is that the public sector may make poor decisions about which projects to fund. Despite its importance, especially for the advancement of basic and early-stage science, there is currently no large-scale empirical evidence on how successfully governments select research investments. Li and Agha analyze more than 130,000 grants funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health during 1980–2008 and find clear benefits of peer evaluations, particularly for distinguishing high-impact potential among the most competitive applications.
Science, this issue p. 434
This paper examines the success of peer-review panels in predicting the future quality of proposed research. We construct new data to track publication, citation, and patenting outcomes associated with more than 130,000 research project (R01) grants funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health from 1980 to 2008. We find that better peer-review scores are consistently associated with better research outcomes and that this relationship persists even when we include detailed controls for an investigator’s publication history, grant history, institutional affiliations, career stage, and degree types. A one–standard deviation worse peer-review score among awarded grants is associated with 15\% fewer citations, 7\% fewer publications, 19\% fewer high-impact publications, and 14\% fewer follow-on patents.
Peer-review panels predict publications, citations, and patents from proposed research.

The convergence rate of the analytic expression is fast – one iteration – for small closed integration domains, and slower for open integration domains when compared to the Monte Carlo integration method. The analytic formulae provide a theoretical framework for calculations in robust estimation, robust regression, outlier detection, design of experiments, and stochastic extensions of deterministic elliptical curves results.},

Because we do not have a good instrumental variable for Catholic school attendance, we develop new estimation methods based on the idea that the amount of selection on the observed explanatory variables in a model provides a guide to the amount of selection on the unobservables. We also propose an informal way to assess selectivity bias based on measuring the ratio of selection on unobservables to selection on observables that would be required if one is to attribute the entire effect of Catholic school attendance to selection bias. We use our methods to estimate the effect of attending a Catholic high school on a variety of outcomes. Our main conclusion is that Catholic high schools substantially increase the probability of graduating from high school and, more tentatively, attending college. We find little evidence of an effect on test scores.},

In the second stage, a simple hypothesis about a component of the structural parameter vector is tested, using a t-statistic that is based on either the ordinary least squares (OLS) or the twostage least squares estimator (2SLS), depending on the outcome of the Hausman pretest. The asymptotic size of the two-stage test is derived in a model where weak instruments are ruled out by imposing a positive lower bound on the strength of the instruments. The asymptotic size equals 1 for empirically relevant choices of the parameter space. The size distortion is caused by a discontinuity of the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic in the correlation parameter between the structural and reduced form error terms. The Hausman pretest does not have sufficient power against correlations that are local to zero while the OLS-based t-statistic takes on large values for such nonzero correlations. Instead of using the two-stage procedure, the recommendation then is to use a t-statistic based on the 2SLS estimator or, if weak instruments are a concern, the conditional likelihood ratio test by Moreira (2003).},

However, the procedure with minimum expected length ordinarily depends on the true value of the parameter. The possibility is explored of minimizing the average expected length, averaging according to some weighting on the possible parameter values.

The study begins by using the worst-case bounds derived by Manski (1989, 1990, 1994, 1995) and adds assumptions from the Roy model of schooling self-selection to narrow the bounds on the schooling treatment effect. The bounds are narrowed further by using family structure, college proximity, and school-quality characteristics as exclusion restrictions. The selection problem requires the researcher to make explicit assumptions to estimate the effect of schooling on earnings.

	abstract = {The literature assessing the efficacy of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, has long puzzled over positive associations between SNAP receipt and various undesirable health outcomes such as food insecurity. Assessing the causal impacts of SNAP, however, is hampered by two key identification problems: endogenous selection into participation and extensive systematic underreporting of participation status. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we extend partial identification bounding methods to account for these two identification problems in a single unifying framework. Specifically, we derive informative bounds on the average treatment effect (ATE) of SNAP on child food insecurity, poor general health, obesity, and anemia across a range of different assumptions used to address the selection and classification error problems. In particular, to address the selection problem, we apply relatively weak nonparametric assumptions on the latent outcomes, selected treatments, and observed covariates. To address the classification error problem, we formalize a new approach that uses auxiliary administrative data on the size of the SNAP caseload to restrict the magnitudes and patterns of SNAP reporting errors. Layering successively stronger assumptions, an objective of our analysis is to make transparent how the strength of the conclusions varies with the strength of the identifying assumptions. Under the weakest restrictions, there is substantial ambiguity; we cannot rule out the possibility that SNAP increases or decreases poor health. Under stronger but plausible assumptions used to address the selection and classification error problems, we find that commonly cited relationships between SNAP and poor health outcomes provide a misleading picture about the true impacts of the program. Our tightest bounds identify favorable impacts of SNAP on child health.},

element \$θ\_\{1\}\$ of a parameter vector \$θ{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{d\}\$ that is
partially identified by affine moment equality and inequality conditions. The
method is based on an estimator of a regularized support function of the

{\textbackslash}emph\{asymptotic linear representation\} which provides closed form standard
errors and enables optimization-free multiplier bootstrap. The proposed CS can
be computed as a solution to a finite number of linear and convex quadratic
programs, which leads to a substantial decrease in {\textbackslash}emph\{computation time\} and
{\textbackslash}emph\{guarantee of global optimum\}. As a result, the method provides uniformly
valid inference in applications with the dimension of the parameter space, \$d\$,
and the number of inequalities, \$k\$, that were previously computationally
unfeasible (\$d,k {\textgreater}100\$). The proposed approach is then extended to construct
polygon-shaped joint CS for multiple components of \$θ\$. Inference for
coefficients in the linear IV regression model with interval outcome is used as
an illustrative example.

It provides a framework for comparing different methods for estimating anticipation effects and proposes a new set of instrumental variables to address the problem that subjects' expectations are unobservable. Finally, this paper examines a specific set of tort reforms that was not targeted at physicians but was likely anticipated by them. Interpreting pre-trends as evidence of anticipation increases the estimated effect of these reforms by a factor of two compared to a model that ignores anticipation.},

	abstract = {Synthetic control methods are commonly applied in empirical research to estimate the effects of treatments or interventions on aggregate outcomes. A synthetic control estimator compares the outcome of a treated unit to the outcome of a weighted average of untreated units that best resembles the characteristics of the treated unit before the intervention. When disaggregated data are available, constructing separate synthetic controls for each treated unit may help avoid interpolation biases. However, the problem of finding a synthetic control that best reproduces the characteristics of a treated unit may not have a unique solution. Multiplicity of solutions is a particularly daunting challenge when the data include many treated and untreated units. To address this challenge, we propose a synthetic control estimator that penalizes the pairwise discrepancies between the characteristics of the treated units and the characteristics of the units that contribute to their synthetic controls. The penalization parameter trades off pairwise matching discrepancies with respect to the characteristics of each unit in the synthetic control against matching discrepancies with respect to the characteristics of the synthetic control unit as a whole. We study the properties of this estimator and propose data-driven choices of the penalization parameter.},

	shorttitle = {Nothing to see here?},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03273},
	abstract = {Many causal models make assumptions of "no difference" or "no effect." For example, difference-in-differences (DID) assumes that there is no trend difference between treatment and comparison groups' untreated potential outcomes ("parallel trends"). Tests of these assumptions typically assume a null hypothesis that there is no violation. When researchers fail to reject the null, they consider the assumption to hold. We argue this approach is incorrect and frequently misleading. These tests reverse the roles of Type I and Type II error and have a high probability of missing assumption violations. Even when power is high, they may detect statistically significant violations too small to be of practical importance. We present test reformulations in a non-inferiority framework that rule out violations of model assumptions that exceed some threshold. We then focus on the parallel trends assumption, for which we propose a "one step up" method: 1) reporting treatment effect estimates from a model with a more complex trend difference than is believed to be the case and 2) testing that that the estimated treatment effect falls within a specified distance of the treatment effect from the simpler model. We show that this reduces bias while also considering power, controlling mean-squared error. Our base model also aligns power to detect a treatment effect with power to rule out meaningful violations of parallel trends. We apply our approach to 4 data sets used to analyze the Affordable Care Act's dependent coverage mandate and demonstrate that coverage gains may have been smaller than previously estimated.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02423},
	abstract = {The method of difference-in-differences (DID) is widely used to study the causal effect of policy interventions in observational studies. DID employs a before and after comparison of the treated and control units to remove bias due to time-invariant unmeasured confounders under the parallel trends assumption. Estimates from DID, however, will be biased if the outcomes for the treated and control units evolve differently in the absence of treatment, namely if the parallel trends assumption is violated. We propose a general identification strategy that leverages two groups of control units whose outcomes relative to the treated units exhibit a negative correlation, and achieves partial identification of the average treatment effect for the treated. The identified set is of a union bounds form that involves the minimum and maximum operators, which makes the canonical bootstrap generally inconsistent and naive methods overly conservative. By utilizing the directional inconsistency of the bootstrap distribution, we develop a novel bootstrap method to construct uniformly valid confidence intervals for the identified set and parameter of interest when the identified set is of a union bounds form, and we establish the method's theoretical properties. We develop a simple falsification test and sensitivity analysis. We apply the proposed strategy for bracketing to study whether minimum wage laws affect employment levels.},

	abstract = {Applied analysts often use the differences-in-differences (DID) method to estimate the causal effect of policy interventions with observational data. The method is widely used, as the required before and after comparison of a treated and control group is commonly encountered in practice. DID removes bias from unobserved time-invariant confounders. While DID removes bias from time-invariant confounders, bias from time-varying confounders may be present. Hence, like any observational comparison, DID studies remain susceptible to bias from hidden confounders. Here, we develop a method of sensitivity analysis that allows investigators to quantify the amount of bias necessary to change a study's conclusions. Our method operates within a matched design that removes bias from observed baseline covariates. We develop methods for both binary and continuous outcomes. We then apply our methods to two different empirical examples from the social sciences. In the first application, we study the effect of changes to disability payments in Germany. In the second, we re-examine whether election day registration increased turnout in Wisconsin.},

It covers a spectrum of equivalence testing problems of both types, ranging from a one-sample problem with normally distributed observations of fixed known variance to problems involving several dependent or independent samples and multivariate data. Along with expanding the material on noninferiority problems, this edition includes new chapters on equivalence tests for multivariate data and tests for relevant differences between treatments. A majority of the computer programs offered online are now available not only in SAS or Fortran but also as R scripts or as shared objects that can be called within the R system.  This book provides readers with a rich repertoire of efficient solutions to specific equivalence and noninferiority testing problems frequently encountered in the analysis of real data sets. It first presents general approaches to problems of testing for noninferiority and two-sided equivalence. Each subsequent chapter then focuses on a specific procedure and its practical implementation. The last chapter describes basic theoretical results about tests for relevant differences as well as solutions for some specific settings often arising in practice. Drawing from real-life medical research, the author uses numerous examples throughout to illustrate the methods.},

We discuss several novel estimators under this framework, including the fixed effects counterfactual estimator, interactive fixed effects counterfactual estimator, and matrix completion estimator. They provide more reliable causal estimates than conventional twoway fixed effects models when treatment effects are heterogeneous or unobserved time-varying confounders exist. Moreover, we propose a new dynamic treatment effects plot, along with several diagnostic tests, to help researchers gauge the validity of the identifying assumptions.

Our main assumption is that the regression function is known to lie in a convex function class, which covers most smoothness and/or shape assumptions used in econometrics. We derive finite-sample optimal CIs and sharp efficiency bounds under normal errors with known variance. We show that these results translate to uniform (over the function class) asymptotic results when the error distribution is not known. When the function class is centrosymmetric, these efficiency bounds imply that minimax CIs are close to efficient at smooth regression functions. This implies, in particular, that it is impossible to form CIs that are substantively tighter using data-dependent tuning parameters, and maintain coverage over the whole function class.

Moreover, we provide further justification for the sup-t band by showing that it is the optimal default choice when the researcher does not know the audience's preferences. Complementing existing plug-in and bootstrap implementations, we propose a computationally convenient Bayesian sup-t band with exact finite-sample simultaneous credibility. In an application to structural VAR impulse response function estimation, the sup-t band—which has been surprisingly overlooked in this setting—is at least 35\% narrower than other off-the-shelf simultaneous bands.},

Such restrictions allow us to formalize the intuition behind the common practice of testing for pre-existing trends while avoiding issues related to pre-testing. The causal eﬀect of interest is partially identiﬁed under such restrictions. We introduce two approaches that guarantee uniformly valid (“honest”) inference under the imposed restrictions, and we derive novel results showing that they have good power properties in our context. We recommend that researchers conduct sensitivity analyses to show what conclusions can be drawn under various restrictions on the possible diﬀerences in trends.},

We also derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when the working models are correctly specified. Furthermore, we quantify the potential efficiency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data.

abstract = {In Abadie and Imbens (2006), it was shown that simple nearest-neighbor matching estimators include a conditional bias term that converges to zero at a rate that may be slower than N1/2. As a result, match- ing estimators are not N1/2-consistent in general. In this article, we propose a bias correction that ren- ders matching estimators N1/2-consistent and asymptotically normal. To demonstrate the methods pro- posed in this article, we apply them to the National Supported Work (NSW) data, originally analyzed in Lalonde (1986). We also carry out a small simulation study based on the NSW example. In this simula- tion study, a simple implementation of the bias-corrected matching estimator performs well compared to both simple matching estimators and to regression estimators in terms of bias, root-mean-squared-error, and coverage rates. Software to compute the estimators proposed in this article is available on the au- thors' web pages (http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/imbens/software.html) and documented in Abadie et al. (2003).},

	abstract = {The synthetic control method (SCM) is a popular approach for estimating the impact of a treatment on a single unit in panel data settings. The “synthetic control” is a weighted average of control units that balances the treated unit’s pretreatment outcomes and other covariates as closely as possible. A critical feature of the original proposal is to use SCM only when the fit on pretreatment outcomes is excellent. We propose Augmented SCM as an extension of SCM to settings where such pretreatment fit is infeasible. Analogous to bias correction for inexact matching, augmented SCM uses an outcome model to estimate the bias due to imperfect pretreatment fit and then de-biases the original SCM estimate. Our main proposal, which uses ridge regression as the outcome model, directly controls pretreatment fit while minimizing extrapolation from the convex hull. This estimator can also be expressed as a solution to a modified synthetic controls problem that allows negative weights on some donor units. We bound the estimation error of this approach under different data-generating processes, including a linear factor model, and show how regularization helps to avoid over-fitting to noise. We demonstrate gains from Augmented SCM with extensive simulation studies and apply this framework to estimate the impact of the 2012 Kansas tax cuts on economic growth. We implement the proposed method in the new augsynth R package.},

This article aims to provide practical guidance to researchers employing synthetic control methods. The article starts with an overview and an introduction to synthetic control estimation. The main sections discuss the advantages of the synthetic control framework as a research design, and describe the settings where synthetic controls provide reliable estimates and those where they may fail. The article closes with a discussion of recent extensions, related methods, and avenues for future research. (JEL B41, C32, C54, E23, F15, O47)},

	abstract = {In a seminal paper Abadie et al (2010) develop the synthetic control procedure for estimating the effect of a treatment, in the presence of a single treated unit and a number of control units, with pre-treatment outcomes observed for all units. The method constructs a set of weights such that covariates and pre-treatment outcomes of the treated unit are approximately matched by a weighted average of control units. The weights are restricted to be nonnegative and sum to one, which allows the procedure to obtain the weights even when the number of lagged outcomes is modest relative to the number of control units, a setting that is not uncommon in applications. In the current paper we propose a more general class of synthetic control estimators that allows researchers to relax some of the restrictions in the ADH method. We allow the weights to be negative, do not necessarily restrict the sum of the weights, and allow for a permanent additive difference between the treated unit and the controls, similar to difference-in-difference procedures. The weights directly minimize the distance between the lagged outcomes for the treated and the control units, using regularization methods to deal with a potentially large number of possible control units.},
